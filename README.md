<h1 align="center">Startpages</h1>

Even though I haven't touched the code of these sites in years, they should be still working in all mainstream web browsers. Be aware that additional tweaking may be required if something doesn't work/display as expected.

### Bright

The website contains an interactive search bar (search results are using DuckDuckGo and open in a new tab), website categories, time & date, weather indicator and random quotes.

### Dark

It isn't exactly a dark home page considering the bright background image. It comes with transparent website categories that are supposed to resemble polaroid photos. There is also an interactive search bar, date and time indicators.

### Dropdown

The main attraction of this webpage is the harmonic menu effect made possible with JavaScript. Clicking on the categories makes them slide open and close if another category is opened or the user clicks outside of the menu area. The site also comes with an interactive search bar, weather, time and date indicators.

### Minimal

A minimalistic webpage with hidden categories – they slide open when the user clicks them utilising the same effect as of the Dropdown start page. Time and date indicators are included along with an interactive search bar.

### Minimal 2

The same as Minimal, but the website categories are no longer hidden and instead grouped into squares.

### Terminal

This start page aims to imitate the command-line terminals of Linux distributions – as if you were actually typing into a terminal window. One day I might make it, so that the user will be able to drag the window around. It comes with an interactive search bar, time and date indicators.

### Zen

It's only different in design from Minimal 2.
